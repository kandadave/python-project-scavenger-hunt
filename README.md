# Urban Quest Creator CLI

A Python-based command-line interface for creating and managing urban scavenger hunt quests, with user-input clues and a SQLite database.

By David Chumo

## Description

This is a robust, interactive CLI application designed to allow users to create, manage, and explore urban scavenger hunt quests. It leverages SQLAlchemy for database operations, Click for the command-line interface, and Alembic for database migrations. The application supports creating users and quests, viewing quest creators, and listing all quests created by a specific user with detailed information including location, type, and clue. It uses a SQLite database (quests.db) for persistence and features a simplified location validation that accepts any non-empty string.



## Features

- **User Management**: Create, delete, list, and find users by ID, with optional email and preferences.
- **Quest Management**: Create, delete, list, and find quests by ID, with details including name, location, type, clue, and creation date.
- **View Quest Creator**: Display the user who created a specific quest.
- **View User's Quests**: List all quests created by a specific user, showing ID, name, location, type, clue, and creation date.
- **ASCII Map Display**: Generate an ASCII art representation of any location using the `art` library.
- **Persistence**: All user and quest data is stored in a SQLite database (`quests.db`) with a schema managed by Alembic migrations.

## How to Use

### Requirements

- A computer with Python 3.8+ installed.
- Pipenv for managing virtual environments and dependencies.
- A terminal/command line.
- A code editor (VS Code recommended).
- SQLite for database operations.

### Installation Process

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/kandadave/urban-quest-creator](https://github.com/kandadave/urban-quest-creator)
cd urban-quest-creator
````

**2. Install Dependencies:**

Navigate to the project root directory and install dependencies using Pipenv:

```bash
pipenv install
```

**3. Activate Virtual Environment:**

```bash
pipenv shell
```

**4. Apply Database Migrations:**

Set up the SQLite database (`quests.db`) with the required schema:

```bash
pipenv run alembic upgrade head
```

**5. (Optional) Seed the Database:**

Populate the database with sample data:

```bash
python lib/db/seed.py
```

### Running the Application

Start the CLI application:

```bash
python -m lib.main
```

Interact with the main menu to:

  - Manage users (create, delete, list, find, view quests).
  - Manage quests (create, delete, list, find, view creator).
  - Display an ASCII map for a location.

**Example usage:**

  - **Create a user**: Select 1 -\> 1, enter name (e.g., Dave), email (e.g., dave@gmail.com), preferences (e.g., Adventure).
  - **Create a quest**: Select 2 -\> 1, enter name (e.g., Archives Mystery), creator ID (e.g., 1), location (e.g., Nairobi), type (e.g., Adventure), clue (e.g., Find the hidden artifact).
  - **View userâ€™s quests**: Select 1 -\> 5, enter user ID (e.g., 1) to see all quests with details.

## Technologies Used

  - **Python 3.8+**: Core programming language for the application.
  - **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for managing SQLite database operations.
  - **Click**: Library for building the command-line interface.
  - **Alembic**: Tool for handling database migrations.
  - **Art**: Library for generating ASCII art maps.
  - **SQLite**: Lightweight database for storing user and quest data.
  - **Pytest**: Framework for running unit tests.
